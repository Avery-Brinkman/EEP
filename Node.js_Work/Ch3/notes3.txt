(err, data) => {} is the same as function(err,data){}

json files seem like they'll work similar to dictionaries

readdir(location, callback)

data for writeFile needs to be a string (or other weird stuff)
since ours was a JSON object, you need to put the whole thing in quotes or use it w/ JSON.stringify()

fs.readFile deals w/ str
require() deals w/ obj
