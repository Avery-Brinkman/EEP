SQL
	Structured Query Language
	Keyword: Structured
	Lots of upfront design work required for setting one up
	Get performance and query benefits as result
	Sometimes performance hits due to the overhead
NoSQL
	No structure, just collections of any data (like how I organize most things :P)
	Less or no up front design

SQL is like an automatic car, NoSQL is manual
MongoDB is NoSQL and often used in 'mean stack'
